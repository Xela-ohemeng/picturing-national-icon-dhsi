counter001,fashion.png,alex_ohemeng,09_12_1989,"Copying the way colonial rulers dressed became a way for early post-independent Ghanaians to make a bold statement using fashion as their ""voice"". Ghanaians weren’t just following a trend by wearing European-style clothing like suits; they were making a statement. Fashion became a way to turn the tools of the colonial rulers back on them, using these symbols of authority and power to challenge the dominance of the colonisers. This act of mimicking wasn’t about conformity but about reclaiming and redefining these symbols on their own terms. Ghanaians showed that they were just as sophisticated, capable, and deserving of respect by adopting the clothing associated with the colonizers. It was a way of saying, ""We can play by your rules and still prove our worth"". Using fashion in this way was part of a larger counter-story where Ghanaians challenged the narrative of inferiority imposed on them during colonial rule. Through this creative act of resistance, they used style and appearance to rewrite their story, showed pride in their identity and asserted their place in a newly independent Ghana. Fashion became more than just clothing—it became a tool for empowerment and self-expression in their fight for equality and recognition.",,/objects/fashion.png,,,,,,png,,,,,,,fashion.png,/objects/fashion.png,/objects/small/fashion_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/fashion_th.jpg
counter002,mobile_service_station.png,alex_ohemeng,09_12_1990,"The automobile service industry began to take shape as part of the broader push for industrialisation and modernisation under the influential leadership of Kwame Nkrumah when Ghana gained independence. The government recognised the importance of automobiles for transportation and economic development, and this led to initiatives aimed at establishing vehicle assembly plants and technical workshops. Vehicles like Bedford trucks, which were assembled in Ghana, were extensively used for transporting goods such as cocoa and foodstuffs, playing a vital role in the economy.",,/objects/mobile_service_station.png,,,,,,png,,,,,,,mobile_service_station.png,/objects/mobile_service_station.png,/objects/small/mobile_service_station_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/mobile_service_station_th.jpg
counter003,police_service.png,alex_ohemeng,09_12_1991,"The Ghana Police Service, as it is known today, evolved from the Gold Coast Police Force following Ghana's independence on March 6, 1957. Initially, the force retained its colonial structure but gradually transitioned to reflect the needs of a democratic state. In 1970, the Police Service Act (Act 350) was enacted, changing its designation from ""Force"" to ""Service"" to emphasise its role in serving the public rather than applying coercive force. The service's mandate includes maintaining public order, ensuring internal peace and security, preventing and detecting crime and prosecuting offenders.",,/objects/police_service.png,,,,,,png,,,,,,,police_service.png,/objects/police_service.png,/objects/small/police_service_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/police_service_th.jpg
counter004,public_socialisation.png,alex_ohemeng,09_12_1992,"Ghanaians often gathered in the evenings to socialise and enjoy one another’s company. These moments were more than just leisurely activities; they became powerful symbols of the newfound freedom and unity of their independent nation. After years of colonial rule, such gatherings represented a joyful reclaiming of their time and space, allowing people to bond and strengthen their sense of community. These evening gatherings also served as a counter-narrative to the colonial period to emphasise that independence granted Ghanaians the freedom to come together as one people, united by shared experiences and aspirations. Whether it was through conversations, music, or communal celebrations, these moments reflected a collective pride in their identity and a vision of a future built on togetherness. Socialising was not just an act of leisure; it was a declaration of self-determination, solidarity, and the ability to celebrate life on their own terms in their newly liberated country",,/objects/public_socialisation.png,,,,,,png,,,,,,,public_socialisation.png,/objects/public_socialisation.png,/objects/small/public_socialisation_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/public_socialisation_th.jpg
counter005,tea_party.png,alex_ohemeng,09_12_1993,"Tea gatherings became more than just casual social events after Ghana's independence—they were a meaningful way for Ghanaians to come together, strengthen their bonds, and celebrate their newfound independence. These gatherings provided a space for connection, conversation, and unity. This reflected the collective pride and optimism of a nation entering a new chapter. Tea as a social event also carried deeper significance. It served as a counter-story to colonial narratives that often relegated traditional Ghanaian social practices to the sidelines while prioritising European customs. Ghanaians sent a message when they made it their own: they were reclaiming and reshaping symbols of power to reflect their own identity and independence by embracing tea culture, an activity associated with colonial elites. These events allowed them to assert that they, too, could engage in rituals once tied to colonial authority, but this time on their terms. Further, tea gatherings symbolised the spirit of togetherness and solidarity that was crucial in building a strong, united Ghana. They offered an opportunity for people to share ideas, discuss the future of their country, and connect as equals. These simple yet meaningful moments became acts of defiance against division. This showed that independence was not just political—it was also cultural and social",,/objects/tea_party.png,,,,,,png,,,,,,,tea_party.png,/objects/tea_party.png,/objects/small/tea_party_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/tea_party_th.jpg
counter006,telephone_exchange.png,alex_ohemeng,09_12_1994,"Women played important roles in shaping Ghana's economic, political and social development after independence. Despite their significant contributions, their efforts were often overlooked in mainstream historical accounts. However, Ghanaian women were actively involved in key areas, such as telecommunications, governance, education, activism, and economic advancement, to help build the foundation of a newly independent nation. Women participated in politics and activism, advocating for national progress and social change. Some took on leadership roles and influenced policy decisions. Others took part in protests and grassroots movements, ensuring that the voices of ordinary citizens were heard in the political arena. In education and professional fields, women helped expand access to learning and professional opportunities. Many worked as teachers, mentors and administrators to guide the next generation and strengthen Ghana’s educational system. Others pursued careers in medicine, law, business, and journalism to pave the way for future generations of women to enter these professions.",,/objects/telephone_exchange.png,,,,,,png,,,,,,,telephone_exchange.png,/objects/telephone_exchange.png,/objects/small/telephone_exchange_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/telephone_exchange_th.jpg
